Note: for PDS3 data sets migrated to PDS4, the following text is taken
verbatim from the data set description and confidence level note of the
PDS3 data set catalog file. In these cases, some details may not be correct
as a description of the PDS4 bundle.
                                                           
    This data set contains the polarimetry of asteroid 25143 Itokawa          
    published in Cellino et al. (2005).  The observations were made           
    from  June 26 through July 3, 2004 with the Torino                        
    photopolarimeter at the 2.15 m telescope of the El Leoncito               
    Observatory in Argentina.  On June 26 and July 1 and 2, weather           
    prevented any useful observations of Itokawa, so the data                 
    presented here are from the other nights of the run.  The degree          
    of linear polarization in five filters (Johnson-Cousins UBVRI) was        
    measured over a wide range of phase angles, between 40 and 80             
    degrees.  The data obtained are sufficient to derive an estimate          
    of the asteroid's geometric albedo of 0.24 +/- 0.01.                      
                                                                              
    The single entries in the table correspond to averages over time          
    spans of about one hour each. Some averaging was done because in          
    polarimetry single measurements have usually fairly large error           
    bars.  During one hour the phase angle did not change by more than        
    one degree, as can be seen from the difference in the phase angle         
    listed in each entry of the table for the same night.                     
                                                                              
    Single polarization measurements consisted of eight photometric           
    measurements corresponding to a cycle of eight different positions        
    of the half-wave plate in front of the polarimeter. A single cycle        
    takes about 3.5 minutes. For Itokawa it was decided that the usual        
    procedure of computing the average nightly polarization, by making        
    an average over all the single measurements taken during the              
    night, was clearly not appropriate.  The reason for not doing so          
    was that the object was moving fast and the phase angle was               
    changing. On the other hand, the phase change was fairly small            
    over intervals of some tens of minutes.                                   
                                                                              
    The average over the cycles continuously executed during time             
    spans of about one hour was adopted as a compromise between the           
    need of documenting the change in polarization for changing phase         
    angle, and the need of having fairly good error bars in the               
    corresponding polarization measurements.                                  
                                                                              
    25143 Itokawa is an S-type asteroid, an NEO, and was the target of        
    the Hayabusa mission.

Known issues or problems with the data
======================================

    Uncertainties for the measurements are given in the table.  Note          
    that albedo was determined by linear extrapolation of the                 
    polarization obtained within the phase angles 40-80 degrees,              
    rather than near the inversion point (20-30 degrees).  For further        
    information about the measurements and analysis, see Cellino et           
    al. (2005).
