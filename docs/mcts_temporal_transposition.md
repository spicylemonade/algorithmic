# Temporal MCTS With Transpositions (Item 013)

Implemented PUCT-style search with:
- Timeline consistency checks
- Optional transposition table over canonicalized frontier states

Benchmark outcome at equal compute:
- Node-efficiency gain observed: ~11.94%
- Required threshold: >=20%

Result marked failed; artifact retained for iteration in next phase.
