# Timeline-Aware Encoder Comparison (Item 011)

Implemented two encoders in `src/fived/learning.py`:
- Tensorized timeline-stack encoder
- Graph-style structural feature encoder

Both were trained on identical targets and compared on the same validation split.
See `results/item_011_encoder_comparison.json` for value-loss outcomes.
