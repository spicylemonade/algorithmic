# Research Hypotheses (Item 004)

1. H1: Timeline-graph encoders reduce validation value MSE versus flat tensor stacks by at least 5%.
2. H2: Legal-action masking improves sample efficiency; target Elo is reached in <=80% of steps relative to unmasked training.
3. H3: Transposition-aware PUCT reduces node expansions by >=20% at matched win rate.
4. H4: Timeline-depth curriculum reduces rolling policy-loss variance by >=25%.
5. H5: Causal-consistency regularization improves timeline trap solve rate by >=10 percentage points.
6. H6: Entropy-aware simulation budgeting improves win rate by >=5 percentage points at fixed wall-clock.

Each hypothesis is falsifiable with explicit metrics and thresholds.
