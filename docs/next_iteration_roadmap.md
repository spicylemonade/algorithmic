# Next Iteration Roadmap

Ranking principle:
- Priority score emphasizes impact, then risk reduction, then implementation effort.

Quarter plan:
- Q1: engine correctness completion, distributed self-play, canonical caching.
- Q2: scale training, add pruning and improved policy targets, broaden robustness suites.
- Q3: population training, latent-dynamics research branch, kernel optimization.
- Q4: tooling/productization, benchmark release, external reproducibility program.
