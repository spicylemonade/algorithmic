# Next-Cycle Roadmap & Risk Register (Item 025)

Prioritized backlog with dependencies, effort estimates, and risk mitigations is provided in:
- `results/item_025_roadmap_risks.json`

Highlights:
1. Fix transposition efficiency gap (highest research risk).
2. Scale policy-value training with tighter generalization controls.
3. Expand stress/adversarial coverage before larger-board scaling.
