# Project Success Criteria (Item 005)

- Win Rate Target: >=65% vs strongest baseline over at least 2,000 balanced games.
- Elo Target: >=+150 Elo vs strongest baseline with 95% confidence interval excluding zero.
- Efficiency Target: >=2x nodes/sec relative to unoptimized MCTS reference.
- Training Cost Target: <=120 GPU-hours on one RTX 4090 to reach target Elo.
- Memory Target: <=12 GB peak inference footprint during tournament settings.

Baselines and compute budgets are fixed to ensure comparable measurements.
