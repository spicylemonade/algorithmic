# Module Inventory (Repo Root)

| Entry | Type | Purpose | Dependency Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.archivara` | directory | Automation/logging workspace generated by orchestration tooling. | Feeds agent logs and run metadata; not required by runtime code. |
| `.git` | directory | Git metadata and history for source control operations. | Used by git CLI for commits, diffs, and branch state. |
| `TASK_researcher.md` | file | Task handoff instructions describing required research workflow. | Referenced by the executing research agent, no runtime dependency. |
| `docs` | directory | Documentation artifacts for design specs, literature review, and reports. | Read by developers/reviewers; generated from research tasks. |
| `figures` | directory | Directory for PNG plots generated from experiment runs. | Written by plotting pipeline and referenced by reports. |
| `main.py` | file | Entry-point placeholder for launching local experiments or demos. | Depends on project modules once implementation is added. |
| `research_rubric.json` | file | Machine-readable execution rubric tracking phase/item statuses and acceptance notes. | Consumed by frontend/progress tracking and updated by scripts/update_rubric.py. |
| `results` | directory | Directory for experiment outputs and structured JSON metrics. | Written by experiment scripts and read by analysis/report tooling. |
| `scripts` | directory | Utility scripts for rubric updates, experiments, and reproducible workflows. | Invoked from shell/CI; depends on Python stdlib and project modules. |
| `src` | directory | Implementation source tree for the AlphaGo-style 5D chess system. | Imported by training, evaluation, and test scripts. |
| `tests` | directory | Automated validation suite for core components and invariants. | Executed by pytest or CI to verify acceptance criteria. |
