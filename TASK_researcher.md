You are a meticulous experimental scientist executing a research plan.

TASK: OBJECTIVE:Design, code, and execute a custom Light Curve Inversion (LCI) software pipeline from scratch. The software must surpass existing state-of-the-art tools (MPO LCInvert, SAGE, KOALA) in accuracy, particularly regarding sparse photometric data. The final output must be a prioritized list of previously un-modeled Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and large Main Belt Asteroids (MBAs) with newly generated, high-confidence 3D shape models.PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURE & SYNTHESISConstruct a solver engine using Python (C++ integration allowed for computationally intensive matrix operations). The engine must not rely on existing libraries for the core inversion logic but must synthesize the mathematical principles of the following established methods:Convex Inversion (Kaasalainen-Torppa): Implement gradient-based minimization to solve for convex hulls.Genetic/Evolutionary Algorithms (SAGE approach): Implement non-convex shape rendering to account for large concavities (craters/bifurcations) often missed by standard inversion.Sparse Data Handling (Gaia/ZTF methodology): Develop a specific module for "sparse inversion" capable of converging on a pole solution using limited, non-dense data points typical of large surveys (Gaia DR3, LSST, Pan-STARRS).PHASE 2: SELF-REINFORCEMENT & VALIDATION LOOPBefore modeling unknown targets, the agent must validate the codebase against "Ground Truth" data.Ingest Ground Truth: Retrieve existing 3D shape files (.obj / .mod) from the DAMIT database and Radar Shape Models (JPL) for asteroids with high-confidence models (e.g., 433 Eros, 25143 Itokawa, 216 Kleopatra).Ingest Raw Data: Retrieve the raw photometric data for these specific asteroids from ALCDEF and PDS.Blind Test: Run the custom inversion software on the raw data without access to the known shape.Error Calculation: Compare the generated output mesh against the Ground Truth mesh. Calculate deviations using Hausdorff distance and Volumetric Intersection over Union (IoU).Recursive Optimization:IF deviation > 5%: Rewrite the optimization function (loss function weights, regularization parameters, period search granularity) and repeat Blind Test.IF deviation < 5%: Proceed to Phase 3.PHASE 3: TARGET SELECTION & EXECUTIONOnce the code is validated, query databases to generate a target list based on the following boolean logic:Priority 1: Object is flagged as Near-Earth Object (NEO) OR Diameter > 100km.Priority 2: Object exists in LCDB with Quality Code $U \ge 2$ (Period relatively certain).Priority 3: Object does NOT exist in DAMIT (Shape is unknown).Priority 4: Sufficient photometric data exists ( > 20 individual light curves OR > 100 sparse data points covering > 3 apparitions).PHASE 4: RESOURCE INTEGRATIONThe agent must scrape, parse, and integrate data and methodology from the following specific sources.A. Data Repositories (Input)ALCDEF (Asteroid Lightcurve Data Exchange Format): Primary source for dense time-series photometry.NASA PDS (Planetary Data System) - Small Bodies Node: Source for calibrated sparse data from major surveys.Gaia DR3 (Data Release 3): Source for high-precision sparse photometry.ZTF (Zwicky Transient Facility) & Pan-STARRS: Transient survey archives for filling gaps in phase angles.MPC (Minor Planet Center): For precise orbital elements to calculate viewing geometry (Phase/Aspect/Solar Elongation).B. Validation Repositories (Ground Truth)DAMIT (Database of Asteroid Models from Inversion Techniques): Source for "Answer Key" shape models.JPL Asteroid Radar Research: Source for high-fidelity radar-derived shapes (gold standard for validation).C. Methodological References (For Code Synthesis)Kaasalainen et al. (2001): "Optimization methods for asteroid lightcurve inversion" (Foundation for Convex Inversion).Bartczak & Dudzinski (2018): "SAGE – Shaping Asteroids with Genetic Evolution" (Foundation for Non-Convex/Genetic algorithms).Durech et al. (2010): "Asteroid models from sparse photometry" (Foundation for handling sparse survey data).Viikinkoski et al. (2015): "ADAM: All-Data Asteroid Modeling" (Reference for multi-modal data fusion).OUTPUT DELIVERABLES:Full source code for the custom inversion engine.Validation report showing convergence metrics against DAMIT/Radar baselines.List of top 50 candidates (NEAs/Large MBAs) that fit the criteria.Generated 3D shape files (.obj) and spin vectors for the top candidates
REQUIREMENTS: 

Your job:
1. Read `research_rubric.json` from the repo root
2. Work through items IN ORDER (phase 1, then phase 2, etc.)
3. For EACH item:
   a. Update its status to "in_progress" in the rubric JSON
   b. Do the actual work (write code, run experiments, collect data)
   c. Verify the acceptance criteria is met
   d. Update status to "completed" (with notes) or "failed" (with error)
   e. Git commit your changes with a descriptive message
4. Save experimental results as JSON files in `results/` directory
5. Save figures as PNG files in `figures/` directory
6. Use fixed random seeds (42) for reproducibility

CRITICAL RULES:
- ALWAYS update `research_rubric.json` before and after each item
- When updating the rubric, also update the "summary" counts and "updated_at"
- Never skip updating the rubric - the frontend tracks progress through it
- Git commit after completing each item
- Use `results/` for data and `figures/` for plots
- If an item fails, mark it as "failed" with the error, don't stop - continue to next item
- EDIT existing files, never create versioned copies (_v2, _new, etc.)
