You are a world-class principal investigator designing a research plan.

TASK: implement an alphago type system to play the game 5d chess well and efficiently
REQUIREMENTS: 

Your job:
1. Deeply analyze the repository codebase - understand every module, its purpose, and how they connect
2. Identify the core research problem and consider state-of-the-art approaches
3. Write `research_rubric.json` in the REPO ROOT with 15-30 items across exactly 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Problem Analysis & Literature Review
   - Phase 2: Baseline Implementation & Metrics
   - Phase 3: Core Research & Novel Approaches
   - Phase 4: Experiments & Evaluation
   - Phase 5: Analysis & Documentation

Each item MUST have:
- Unique id (e.g. "item_001")
- Descriptive title in "description"
- Specific, measurable "acceptance_criteria"
- "status": "pending"

The rubric JSON MUST follow this exact schema:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "created_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "updated_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "current_agent": "orchestrator",
  "agent_status": {
    "orchestrator": { "status": "in_progress", "started_at": "<ISO>", "completed_at": null, "error": null },
    "researcher": { "status": "pending", "started_at": null, "completed_at": null, "error": null },
    "writer": { "status": "pending", "started_at": null, "completed_at": null, "error": null }
  },
  "phases": [
    {
      "id": "phase_1",
      "name": "Problem Analysis & Literature Review",
      "order": 1,
      "items": [
        {
          "id": "item_001",
          "description": "Analyze repository structure",
          "acceptance_criteria": "Document listing all major modules and their purposes",
          "status": "pending",
          "notes": null,
          "error": null
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "summary": { "total_items": 25, "completed": 0, "in_progress": 0, "failed": 0, "pending": 25 }
}
```

CRITICAL RULES:
- Do NOT implement anything. Only plan and write the rubric.
- Be specific and actionable in acceptance criteria.
- Ensure items build on each other logically.
- Write the rubric to the REPO ROOT as `research_rubric.json`.
- After writing, verify the JSON is valid by reading it back.

mcp startup: no servers
codex
I’ll map the repository first, then inspect each major module to infer architecture and research constraints before drafting the 5-phase rubric JSON. None of the listed skills directly apply here, so I’m proceeding with direct codebase analysis.

**Testing sandbox permission workaround**
codex
I hit a sandbox execution restriction on direct shell commands, so I’m switching to the escalated execution mode available in this environment to continue repository inspection.

thinking
**Exploring alternative resource access**
codex
I can’t use shell execution in this session due enforced sandbox policy, so I’m attempting repository access via MCP resources as a fallback path.

**Preparing rubric generation plan**
codex
I can still write files directly, so I’m creating a detailed 25-item rubric now with the exact schema and five required phases. I’ll then perform a strict JSON parse check via a non-shell fallback to confirm validity as far as this environment allows.

I’m blocked by an environment-level sandbox failure: every filesystem tool call (`exec_command`, `apply_patch`) crashes with `Sandbox(LandlockRestrict)`, so I cannot read the repo, write `research_rubric.json`, or read it back for verification in this session.

I’m blocked by an environment-level sandbox failure: every filesystem tool call (`exec_command`, `apply_patch`) crashes with `Sandbox(LandlockRestrict)`, so I cannot read the repo, write `research_rubric.json`, or read it back for verification in this session.

Below is the rubric content matching your required schema (25 items, exactly 5 phases, all `pending`), ready to place at `/home/codex/work/repo/research_rubric.json`:
